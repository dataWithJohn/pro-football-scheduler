# pro-football-scheduler
![Football Player](images/player.png)
How It Works

    The main script, controllingScript.py, calls two helper scripts:

        shuffle.py

        makeAWeek.py (excluded from GitHub)

    After the schedule is generated, run makePrintOut.py to display the schedule in a clean, human-readable format.

Setup

    Before running any scripts, you need to manually create a matchups.fil, byes.fil, week-to-games.fil, and teams.fil file that contains the predefined details for the league schedule.

Requirements

    The scripts use the shebang line: #!/usr/bin/python3

    Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system to run them.
